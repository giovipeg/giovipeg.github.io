## Kairos

<p><b>ERC rover</b></p>
<ul>
  [R]overTech is a branch of <a href="https://polispace.it/">Polispace</a>, a student association of Milan Polytechnic University. We are currently working on a rover for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Rover_Challenge">ERC</a> competition.
  <br />
  I'm responsible for the control of the main powertrain. This is carried out using the ROS 2 framework, specifically ros2_control. Wittenstein's Symco servo actuators are interfaced via EtherCAT with an Nvidia Jetson Nano board which runs Isaac ROS.
