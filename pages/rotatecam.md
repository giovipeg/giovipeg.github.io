<ul>
  Developed in 2022 in the middle of what turned out to be the last 
  period of school from home caused by the pandemic. It was a small 
  3D printed stand for USB webcams controlled with a Telegram bot 
  that allowed us to tilt remotely the stand which was at school. It 
  was created to follow the teachers during lesson. Before that 
  teachers often had to adjust the camera manually to switch between 
  different areas of the blackboard. Luckily the recovery from the 
  pandemic started just before it was finished, so we decided to 
  complete the project anyway, but it has never been actually used 
  apart from some demonstartions.
