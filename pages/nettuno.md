  RoboCup is a global robotics competition with several specialties.
  Here you can see the fourth iteration of our robot. 
  I've been responsible for the mechanical 
  design and for part of the coding. I've developed 
  a program which had to find some balls using ML object detection and I've co-developed the line following software.
  <br />
  We developed the robot from scratch and learned a lot along the way. Not only we understood a 
  lot of concepts regarding robotics, we learned to how 
  to organize team-working and how to carry out successfully such a 
  complicated project as well.
