  Wooden packaging makers often produce small batches of custom products.
  Each article has to be designed first, but most of these companies don't have the resources to create 
  a CAD model of each product since that is a time (and cost) consuming process.
  Therefore I developed this FreeCAD add-on to 
  automate the design of wooden pallets and crates for a local company. 
  The software allows the user to customize an automatically generated 
  3D model simply by entering the specifications of the pallet/crate. 
  Afterwards it can automatically generate the related 2D drawing as well.
