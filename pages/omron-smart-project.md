<ul>
  I've been part of the school team developing the software and the HMI 
  (Human-Machine Interface), a graphical interface for a small 
  industrial like assembly line.
  <br />
  The work represented the school in the Omron Smart Project cup.
  <br />
  You can see the simulation of the HMI in the video above.
