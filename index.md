## About Me:

Hi! I'm **Giovanni Pegoraro**, a student from the **Vicenza area in Italy**. I've studied **Electronics and Automation** in High School and I plan to continue this path next year at the **Polytechnic University of Milan**. Ever since I was a child who played with Legos, I enjoyed the process of creating things. Giving life to new ideas has always fascinated me and that is why I decided to study Engineering.

I'm especially keen to **robotics** because it's at the intersection of many different subjects and I hope to be able to work in that field one day.
